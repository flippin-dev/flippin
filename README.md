## [ðŸŸ¦ Play here]({https://flippin-dev.github.io/flippin/)

## Gameplay

- The goal of Flippin is to flip tiles on a starting board until they match a target end board.
- Press a tile to flip it and the surrounding tiles to the next color in the cycle.
- Tiles follow a 3 color cycle when flipped: ðŸŸ¥ -> ðŸŸ© -> ðŸŸ¦ -> ðŸŸ¥
- Press the restart button if you get stuck and want to start over.

## Tips

- If you make a move and want to undo it without resetting, press the tile 2 more times to undo it.
- Try looking at surrounding tiles and see if they all need to be flipped to match the end board.
- The order in which you flip tiles to solve the puzzle does not matter.
- If the flipping animations are intrusive, they can be disabled from the settings menu.

## Custom Themes

Custom color themes can be added through a prompt in the settings menu. They will then show up in the themes list also found in the settings menu. Colors are provided in 6-digit hex code format (e.g. #e92f3f). Any colors can be used, but it is recommended to choose colors that look good in either light mode or dark mode and are visually distinct from each other.

## Custom Puzzles

Custom puzzles can be added through a prompt in the settings menu. They will then show up in the freeplay puzzles list also found in the settings menu. A title, starting board state, and end board state must be provided for each puzzle. The board state values are provided as a string of 25 numbers (0, 1, or 2) read as the tile values left-to-right and row-by-row. The numbers 0, 1, and 2 represent the theme colors associated with each tile. For easier editing of the board states, try to first format them in a grid similar to how they would appear in the puzzle before making them match the expected format of the import prompt.

## Local Storage

Flippin can optionally use your device's local storage to keep track of the following information:
